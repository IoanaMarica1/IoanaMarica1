### Core Technical Skills
| Category | Competencies | Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Programming Languages** | Java, Python, C++ | Intermediate |
| **Core Concepts** | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) | Solid |
| **Networking & Concurrency** | TCP/UDP, Multi-threading, Message Routing | Practiced |
| **Python Data Tools** | NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook | Practiced |

### Seeking Internship
I am actively seeking a software development internship for the winter period, focusing on **Back-end Development (Java/Python)** or **Software Engineering**, where I can apply my knowledge of concurrency and networking.

### Key Projects: Proof of Competency
Please explore my main repositories, which showcase proficiency in diverse architectures and technologies:

#### 1. Networked Client-Server Application (Wordle)
* **Core Skill:** **Networking & Multi-threading**
* **Description:** A robust Wordle Client-Server solution with a multi-threaded **Python** server (Docker-ready) and a **JavaFX** client.
* **Technical Proof:** Implemented **bidirectional TCP and UDP communication** and message routing logic to handle concurrent clients.

#### 2. Foundational Game Engine Implementation
* **Core Skill:** **Software Design & Java Core**
* **Description:** A Pac-Man clone developed in Java Swing, focusing on stability and design.
* **Technical Proof:** Utilizes a **State Machine** pattern for application flow management and a stable **Game Loop** running safely on the **EDT** (Event Dispatch Thread) to prevent concurrency issues.

#### 3. Three-Layer C++ Management System
* **Core Skill:** **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Architecture**
* **Description:** A console-based management system designed to demonstrate structured code.
* **Technical Proof:** The project is organized into a clear **three-layered architecture (Domain, Repository, UI)**, emphasizing **Encapsulation** and **file-based persistence**.
